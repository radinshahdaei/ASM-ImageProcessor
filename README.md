# Assembly Image Processor

This repository contains the project for the Computer Structure and Language course in the Fall 2023 semester. In this project, a convolution is performed between a custom kernel and an image. For usage, just run the `convolution.sh` script located in the `Convolution` folder. Take notice that this project only works on X86 machines.
